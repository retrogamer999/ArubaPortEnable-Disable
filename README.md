Simple script accessing the API of Ariba AOS switches using PowerShell

This script has been tested with PowerShell v7 with the Aruba  PowerArubaSW PowerShell Module

Dependencies:

    1. SSL certificate generated on your switch
    2. HTTPS enabled on the switches web-server
    3. Admin credentials

The credentials are stored within the script, but there is no reason why they cannot be stored elsewhere and somewhere secure.

Support
Aruba-provided scripts in this and other GitHub projects do not fall under the regular Aruba technical support scope and are not supported by Sruba Support Services.
